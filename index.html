            <strong>I am taking this class because:</strong>
            Ever since I entered WashU, I've had numerous opportunities to improve my programming skills and I have gained much
            experience, but nonetheless I don't know how to design a web interface, which I feel is essential for any computer 
            scientist to have some basic knowledge of. Additionally, I've been interested in making a website of my own since I
            first began programming a few years ago and this class felt as the perfect opportunity to fufill that desire and further
            my computer science degree. I'm excited to get to create something beyond the scope of the console output and implement 
            some design principles I've learned from other courses I've taken.
